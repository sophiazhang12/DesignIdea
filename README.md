# DesignIdea
Rough Brainstorm:
It can be like flappy bird, but instead of having to press space to jump up repeatedly, you just hit the up arrow and down arrow to slide up and down the screen. The rest of the screen moves horizontally, so you are always moving forward, just like in flapppy bird. The icon will not be flappy bird but a nyan cat. As you move, you have to dodge obstacles just like in flappy bird, but also need to collect game tokens like coins. When you collide with the coins, your score increments, and so does the size of the nyan cat player. Of course, this would make navigating the pipe obstacles harder since there isn't as much leeway. After a certain threshold (when it is no longer feasible for cat to get through pipes at all), the nyan cat moves through a portal, taking it to the next stage. Think of flappy bird combined with geometry dash combined with subway surfers. However, that would be too easy: after every ten seconds, the map would flip upside down (so all the obstacles would be reversed), and you would have to quickly adjust to not hit anything. After collecting a bubble (appears on your screen like coins), your nyan cat can activate a shield for 3 seconds, which gives it the ability to pass through obstacles without dying. The shield can be activated by hitting the space bar and automatically deactivates after 3 seconds. You can still collect coins with the shield activated. If the cat hits the obstacle it dies instantly, but you are given the opportunity to restart from the beginning of whatever stage you are on without losing your coins three times. There will be nine levels total (because nine lives lmao). On the later levels, there may be harder obstacle, such as 'red zones', where you need to have your shield activated in order to survive. There may be other power-ups as well.
